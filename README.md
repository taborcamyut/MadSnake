A snake game with added items.  


This game **requires `customtkinter`**.

You can install it by running this in command prompt (if you use Windows):

```bash
pip install customtkinter
```

Or by running this in terminal (if you have a Mac):

```bash
pip3 install customtkinter
```

I made this game by modifying an existing snake game: https://github.com/rajatdiptabiswas/snake-pygame  
Code was also used from: https://gist.github.com/wynand1004/ec105fd2f457b10d971c09586ec44900
